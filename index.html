				Although story points offer many advantages, they are not a widely accepted practice, even for those who use Agile Methods and Scrum. 
			    This is because there are several notable limitations to story points too.
				One way story points can be difficult is that they require a shift in thought from time to points. 
				As a result, developers might be tempted to treat points like hours; however, this limitation could be resolved through increased exposure and use of story points, as leading developers become more familiar with the system.

				Estimates are always difficult to make accurately, whether with hours or story points. 
				Although using relative sizes generally results in more accurate estimates than using exact numbers, this is still open to mistakes. 
				For example, it can be difficult to tell if a horizontal line and a vertical line are the same length, even if both are visible at the same time. 
				This effect is known as the vertical–horizontal illusion.

				In large teams, story points are also open to limitations. 
				Sometimes, story points are inflated to give the appearance of productivity. 
				This practice is acceptable if it’s applied consistently, but if inflation of numbers rises halfway through the project 
				due to the introduction of new features or pressures, then story points will lose value and become less useful for estimation.
